These contracts allow IoT devices to expand their functionalities and actions based on data received from other devices, enable users to trust data from IoT devices owned by others, and automate the data-sharing process.\\n1\\n.\\nHow FidesInnova’s Service Contracts Enable Seamless Data Sharing?\\nService contracts are script-based codes designed to encode business logic between IoT devices, allowing them to communicate and share data without the need for a central authority. Similar to smart contracts in blockchain technology, these contracts operate specifically within the decentralized IoT space. They are automated, self-executing, and enforceable through code, ensuring secure and transparent transactions and interactions between parties, all without intermediaries.\\nExecuted on FidesInnova IoT nodes, service contracts utilize a virtual machine (VM) capable of running JavaScript. This enables the creation and execution of complex interactions between IoT devices and users, enhancing adaptability and expanding functionality within IoT ecosystems.\\n2. Key Features and Components of Service Contracts\\nVisual and Text-Based Development:\\nThe FidesInnova Web App accommodates both novice and experienced developers, allowing service contracts to be created using either Blockly or JavaScript. The Visual Console, utilizing Blockly, offers a graphical development method, while the Text-based Console, based on JavaScript syntax, caters to traditional coding practices.\\nZero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Support:\\nAny data received from IoT devices coded in a service contract can contain a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) that demonstrates the accuracy of the code execution on the IoT device. The service contract includes an internal ZKP verifier that automatically verifies the received ZKP before executing the logic based on the data or sending a command to another IoT device.\\nMQTT Protocol Support:\\nThe development environment can receive data and send commands to any IoT device that supports the MQTT protocol.\\nBlockchain Integration:\\nService contracts are integrated with blockchain technology to leverage decentralized and secure networks. This ensures that all agreements coded in a service contract, along with devices and ZKPs, are transparent, immutable, and tamper-resistant. The blockchain also verifies data collected from zk-IoT devices, enhancing system reliability.\\nData Management and Monetization:\\nUsers can share or sell data collected from IoT devices (e.g., temperature, humidity, air quality, and noise levels) through automated service contracts that define how data is collected, accessed, and monetized.\\nDecentralized Service Contract Execution:\\nFidesInnova leverages ZKP technology to enable any IoT server in its network to execute a service contract. This decentralized execution eliminates the need for a trusted IoT server, improving efficiency and reducing costs by minimizing intermediaries. To ensure optimal performance, FidesInnova integrates the isolated-vm technology. This isolation prevents errors or resource leaks in service contracts from affecting the overall system. Additionally, FidesInnova creates multiple isolated contexts within a single Node.js process to prevent runaway code from consuming excessive resources, allowing independent execution of multiple service contract instances and enhancing system stability.\\n3. Functionality and Use Cases\\nAutomated Building Management:\\nService contracts can be customized to manage various building environment sensors, such as air quality control, noise monitoring, temperature, and humidity. These contracts automate processes by linking real-time sensor data to specific actions, streamlining management and reducing the need for manual intervention. For example, a service contract could be programmed to send a notification to the strata company if noise from a unit or apartment persists for more than 30 minutes after 9:00 PM.\\nIoT Device Communication:\\nService contracts enable IoT devices to communicate autonomously. For example, if a building’s multi-sensor detects unsafe CO2 levels, the service contract can trigger an alert or automatically adjust ventilation systems, enhancing safety and reducing response times. Similarly, if the house temperature exceeds 40 degrees Celsius, a service contract can trigger a siren on a speaker. Additionally, if high temperature and humidity persist for an extended period, posing a mould risk to the building, the system can send a notification to the owner or management company.\\nData Visualization:\\nThe TrustSense project, built on FidesInnova technology, is an example of environmental data visualization. It allows users to share their devices and create a visual map of their environmental data. Currently running in British Columbia, Canada, the project can be accessed at\\nwww.trustsense.tech\\nGas Detection and Response System:\\nThe EnergyWiseNetwork project, built on FidesInnova technology, exemplifies gas sensor automation. Service contracts are crucial in this context for automating and managing the monitoring of critical parameters such as gas leak detection, environmental safety, and equipment performance in real time. The project can be accessed at\\nwww.energywisenetwork.com\\n4. Service Contract Example: Noise Monitoring and Management in Residential Buildings\\nObjective:\\nTo deploy a service contract that monitors noise levels in a residential building. The service contract will trigger actions such as notifying building management when noise exceeds a predefined threshold and taking corrective measures, such as issuing warnings to tenants.\\nSteps for Deploying a Service Contract on the Blockly Platform:\\n1. Define the Conditions (Noise Level Monitoring):\\nThe service contract is programmed to monitor noise levels using multi-sensors installed in common areas and individual units of the building.\\nA noise threshold (e.g., 70 decibels, commonly associated with loud conversations or party noise) is set as the condition for triggering the contract.\\n2. Set Data Inputs (Real-Time Noise Data):\\nThe sensors send real-time noise level data to the TrustSense platform, which aggregates and validates the data to ensure only accurate and secure data is used to trigger the service contract.\\nAdditional data, such as the time of day and the location within the building where the noise is detected, is also captured for context.\\n3. Define the Responses (Automated Actions):\\nPrimary Response:\\nIf noise levels exceed the threshold, the service contract automatically sends a notification to the building manager via the TrustSense app or web app dashboard.\\nSecondary Response:\\nIf the high noise persists or exceeds a critical level (e.g., 90 decibels), the contract triggers additional actions, such as sending an automated warning message to the responsible tenant or adjusting soundproofing systems in the affected areas.\\nData Logging:\\nThe service contract logs the noise event on the blockchain, creating an immutable record for future reference or disputes. This can be used to address tenant complaints or monitor chronic noise issues.\\n5. Deploy the Service Contract:\\nUsing the Blockly platform, the service contract is built by dragging and dropping visual blocks representing the conditions and actions defined above. Once the contract logic is completed, it is deployed on the blockchain. The deployed contract now autonomously monitors noise levels and responds to real-time data from the sensors.\\n6. Steps to Deploy Your Desired Service Contract:\\nGo to the FidesInnova website.\\nFrom the Product menu, select the Web App option.\\nIn the Web App menu, choose the specific web app you need from the FidesInnova ecosystem and access it.\\nIn the dashboard, select the Create New Service option.\\nIn this section, input the details of your Service Contract and click the Create button at the end.\\nThen, in the dashboard, navigate to the My Services section to view the created service contract.\\nFrom the Code menu, enter the Blockly environment, where you can program and create the code related to your service contract.\\nOnce you have finished, click Save to create your service contract.\\nFinally, by pressing the Publish button from My Services men, your service contract will be submitted for final approval by the admin and then published to the Service Market.\\nTags:\\nService Contract\\nSharing Data\\nzk-IoT\\n0\\nLikes\\nPost navigation\\nPrevious\\nDecentralized Delegated Proof-of-Stake (D2PoS)\\nMay 9, 2024\\nNext\\nService Market\\nOctober 3, 2024\\nLeave a comment\\nCancel reply\\nName\\nE-mail\\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\\nComment\\nI agree that my submitted data is being collected and stored.

While DPoS introduced a more energy-efficient and scalable alternative to Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus, it also introduced concerns about centralization due to the limited number of block producers, commonly referred to as delegates or validators, responsible for validating transactions and forging new blocks.\\nD2PoS emerges as a response to the centralization concerns of DPoS, aiming to strike a balance between efficiency and decentralization within a blockchain network. At its core, D2PoS maintains the fundamental principles of DPoS while implementing mechanisms to enhance the decentralization aspect.\\nOne of the primary areas of enhancement in D2PoS lies in the governance structure. In traditional DPoS systems, the selection of delegates is often based on voting mechanisms where token holders can vote for delegates. However, this process can lead to a concentration of power among a few prominent delegates, potentially compromising the decentralization of the network.\\nTo tackle this issue, D2PoS introduces innovative approaches such as rotating or randomizing delegate selection. This strategy aims to prevent the accumulation of power in the hands of a limited number of delegates by periodically reshuffling the selection of block producers. By doing so, D2PoS strives to distribute responsibilities across a larger pool of participants, fostering a more decentralized network architecture.\\nMoreover, D2PoS emphasizes the importance of transparency and accountability among delegates. Improved mechanisms for monitoring and auditing delegate performance are integrated into the protocol. These mechanisms include real-time reporting of activities, public validation of blocks produced, and stricter rules for delegate behavior. Such measures contribute to building trust within the network and mitigating potential issues related to misbehavior or centralization tendencies among delegates.\\nIn addition to governance enhancements, D2PoS also focuses on ensuring robust security and scalability features. Through a combination of cryptographic techniques and consensus algorithms, D2PoS aims to fortify the network against potential attacks while maintaining high throughput and low latency.\\nThe implementation of D2PoS has garnered attention within the blockchain community, attracting interest from various projects seeking to improve the efficiency and decentralization of their networks. Its potential applications span across diverse industries, including finance, supply chain management, decentralized applications (dApps), and more, where the need for a secure and scalable consensus mechanism is paramount.\\nHowever, despite its promising features, D2PoS faces certain challenges on its path to widespread adoption. Balancing decentralization without compromising efficiency remains a delicate task. Additionally, fine-tuning the protocol to ensure optimal performance while maintaining a high level of security demands continuous research and development efforts.\\nIn conclusion, Decentralized Delegated Proof-of-Stake (D2PoS) represents a significant advancement in blockchain consensus mechanisms, aiming to address the centralization concerns prevalent in earlier iterations of DPoS. By integrating enhanced governance structures, bolstering security measures, and emphasizing decentralization, D2PoS stands as a promising model capable of fostering more inclusive and resilient blockchain networks, poised to shape the future of decentralized technologies.\\nTags:\\nblockchain\\nconsensus algorithms\\nd2pos\\nproof of stake\\n0\\nLikes\\nPost navigation\\nPrevious\\nWhat’s Web 3.0?\\nMarch 10, 2024\\nNext\\nService Contract in zk-IoT: Automating Data Sharing\\nOctober 3, 2024\\nLeave a comment\\nCancel reply\\nName\\nE-mail\\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\\nComment\\nI agree that my submitted data is being collected and stored.

By leveraging this technology, the problem of Wi-Fi blind spots in network deployment, especially for large areas will be solved.\\nFides MIoTN is a wireless communication network that uses Wi-Fi in STA-AP modes. In Fides MIoTN configuration, all nodes will search for nearby IoTs in the same Wi-Fi port as the user’s router. Organized nodes in mesh topology can self-form and self-heal their network. It makes it particularly well-suited for the decentralized nature of IoT applications.\\nKey Characteristics of Fides Mesh IoT Network:\\n1- Self-Healing Topology:\\nIn traditional networks, the failure of a central hub can disrupt the entire system. Fides MIoTN, however, are resilient and self-healing. The root node will broadcast a message every 3 seconds to the whole network and declare its status. It will guarantee if one node fails, the network can autonomously and quickly detect the failure point and reroute communication through alternative paths, ensuring continuous connectivity.\\n2- Scalability:\\nMesh networks are highly scalable. As new devices join the network, they seamlessly integrate without a central management authority. This scalability makes mesh networks ideal for IoT applications, where the number of connected devices can vary dynamically. Fides MIoTN topology can support up to 1000 nodes and can scale up to 6 layers of IoT devices.\\n3- Redundancy and Reliability:\\nThe redundant paths in a mesh network enhance reliability. Even if one communication route is compromised, Fides IoT devices can find alternative paths to maintain connectivity. This redundancy is crucial for applications that demand high reliability and uptime.\\nTo create the mesh network, we incorporate the painlessMesh library. It is a true ad-hoc network, meaning that no planning, central controller, or router is required. Any system of one or more nodes will self-organize into a fully functional mesh. The maximum size of the mesh is limited by the amount of memory in the heap that can be allocated to the sub-connections buffer.\\nFig 1 demonstrates all possible node statuses. In a mesh, one device will connect to the Wi-Fi router and become the Root, acting as a bridge between the mesh network and MQTT broker. A Parent Node is a device that connects to another node in the mesh and also serves as an intermediary for other nodes. A Leaf Node is always at the end of hops, or there are no devices connected to them. Additionally, if a device can’t find any mesh or router nearby, it will be an Idle Node, constantly searching and trying to find a mesh network or router to connect to.\\nFides MIoTN added few new feature to the painlessMesh that was missing from the library. In Fides MIoTN, instead of hardcoding a status (Root/Node) in the code and then programming the device, devices can autonomously change their status to Node or Root by searching their surrounding area and looking for a mesh network or Wi-Fi router. This feature enables every device to change its state based on the required status. For example, if only one device is near the router, it will select the role of Root automatically, and other devices, by searching, can find that there is an active mesh network nearby, and they will all change their state to Node and form a mesh.\\nTo ensure that the Root device has access to the internet and MQTT broker, every few seconds it will broadcast a message to the whole mesh network. If the Root device loses its connection to the Router or MQTT broker, it switches its own state to Node and lets another Node take its place and become Root. The first Node that can connect to the Router and the MQTT broker will be the new Root and broadcast its state to the mesh. In a case where a new device connects to the router and finds a Root device already existing on the same network, it starts a search for a nearby mesh network. If it can find one, it will instantly switch back to Node and form a mesh with the Root device. But if it can’t find the mesh network, it means that it is not in the signal range of any device, and instead of switching to Node, it will remain Root and start its own mesh network.\\nTags:\\nMesh IoT Network\\nMIoTN\\n0\\nLikes\\nPost navigation\\nPrevious\\nConsensus Algorithms\\nDecember 9, 2023\\nNext\\nFides Service Contracts: Unlocking Innovation and Monetization Opportunities\\nFebruary 14, 2024\\nLeave a comment\\nCancel reply\\nName\\nE-mail\\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\\nComment\\nI agree that my submitted data is being collected and stored.

They facilitate the process of achieving a shared, consistent state in a decentralized environment where multiple entities interact without a central authority. These algorithms are fundamental in various fields, notably in blockchain technology, where they determine how transactions are validated and added to the ledger.\\nSeveral consensus algorithms exist, each designed with specific features, trade-offs, and use cases. Among them, Proof-of-Work (PoW) stands as the pioneer, introduced by Bitcoin. PoW requires nodes, known as miners, to solve complex cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions and add blocks to the blockchain. It’s highly secure but energy-intensive due to its computational requirements.\\nAnother popular consensus mechanism is Proof-of-Stake (PoS), where validators are chosen to create blocks based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to “stake” as collateral. PoS is energy-efficient but sometimes criticized for potential centralization tendencies, favoring those with more tokens.\\nDelegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) is a variant of PoS where token holders vote for a limited number of delegates who then validate transactions and produce blocks. DPoS aims for scalability but can face centralization risks if a small group of delegates accumulates power.\\nPractical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) is a classic consensus algorithm focusing on efficiency in permissioned networks. It requires a fixed number of nodes to agree on the order of transactions and ensures tolerance against a certain number of faulty nodes.\\nAsynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (ABFT) algorithms, like Honey Badger BFT, prioritize scalability and can handle various forms of faults and asynchrony in the network. They’re complex but robust against Byzantine faults, making them suitable for high-throughput systems.\\nDirected Acyclic Graph (DAG) based algorithms, exemplified by Tangle in IOTA, use a non-linear structure where each transaction confirms previous transactions. This approach aims for scalability and zero transaction fees but faces challenges regarding network security and robustness.\\nEach consensus algorithm comes with its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different contexts. Factors like scalability, security, energy efficiency, decentralization, and fault tolerance determine their suitability for specific applications. Some algorithms excel in public, permissionless networks, like cryptocurrencies, while others suit permissioned or private environments.\\nThe evolution of consensus algorithms continues with ongoing research and the emergence of hybrid models combining the advantages of multiple approaches. Innovations aim to address existing limitations, striving for better scalability, security, and decentralization without compromising efficiency.\\nUnderstanding these algorithms and their trade-offs is crucial for designing robust and efficient distributed systems. Moreover, as the technology landscape evolves, consensus algorithms will remain a focal point, driving the advancement and adoption of decentralized technologies in various domains.\\nTags:\\nblockchain\\nconsensus algorithms\\n0\\nLikes\\nPost navigation\\nPrevious\\nMQTT and MQTTS protocols\\nOctober 10, 2023\\nNext\\nFidesinnova Mesh IoT Network (MIoTN): A Revolution in Connectivity\\nFebruary 10, 2024\\nLeave a comment\\nCancel reply\\nName\\nE-mail\\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\\nComment\\nI agree that my submitted data is being collected and stored.

Developed by IBM in the late 1990s, MQTT has gained widespread adoption due to its simplicity, low bandwidth usage, and suitability for constrained environments.\\nMQTT operates on a publish-subscribe model, enabling communication between publishers (devices that send messages) and subscribers (devices that receive messages). This model fosters asynchronous communication, allowing devices to publish messages to a central broker without needing to know the identity or location of the subscribers interested in those messages.\\nThe protocol operates over TCP/IP, making it highly versatile and compatible with various network infrastructures. Its lightweight nature is attributed to its minimal header overhead, making it ideal for scenarios where bandwidth and power resources are limited, such as in sensor networks or remote devices.\\nMQTT’s messaging hierarchy consists of topics, which act as channels for message transmission. Devices can subscribe to specific topics or publish messages to them, enabling selective communication and reducing unnecessary data transmission.\\nMQTTS (MQTT Secure) is an extension of MQTT that incorporates Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to ensure secure communication between MQTT clients and the broker. This encryption provides authentication, confidentiality, and integrity, protecting sensitive data from eavesdropping or tampering.\\nThe security features of MQTTS mitigate risks associated with transmitting data over unsecured networks, crucial in IoT environments where data privacy and security are paramount. By encrypting the communication channel, MQTTS safeguards against unauthorized access and ensures that only authorized devices can interact with the broker.\\nMQTT and MQTTS find extensive applications across various industries. They are employed in smart home automation, industrial IoT, healthcare monitoring systems, telemetry, and more. For instance, in smart homes, MQTT facilitates communication between sensors, smart appliances, and control systems, allowing seamless interaction and automation.\\nHowever, while MQTT and MQTTS offer numerous advantages, including scalability and efficiency, they also pose certain challenges. Scalability concerns arise when handling a massive number of devices, potentially overwhelming the broker and affecting performance. Additionally, the reliance on a central broker introduces a single point of failure, necessitating robust strategies for fault tolerance and high availability in critical deployments.\\nContinuous developments in the IoT landscape drive the evolution of MQTT and MQTTS, with efforts directed towards enhancing security, scalability, and interoperability. The ongoing refinement of these protocols aims to address existing limitations and adapt to the changing demands of the IoT ecosystem.\\nIn conclusion, MQTT and its secure counterpart, MQTTS, stand as efficient, lightweight protocols pivotal in enabling seamless communication and data exchange in IoT environments. Their simplicity, low overhead, and support for secure communication make them integral components in the proliferation of interconnected devices, shaping the future of IoT applications across diverse industries.\\nTags:\\niot\\nmqtt\\nmqtts\\n1\\nLike\\nPost navigation\\nNext\\nConsensus Algorithms\\nDecember 9, 2023\\nLeave a comment\\nCancel reply\\nName\\nE-mail\\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\\nComment\\nI agree that my submitted data is being collected and stored.

Device Configuration File\\nFidesinnova offers a mobile app to control IoT devices that support the MQTT protocol. The device configuration files, which specify the IoT device types, are stored on the IoT server. In this section, we will review how to create a device configuration file on the server. Each device in the configuration file is represented by an image, a title, a type, and its parameters:\\nfileName\\n: Refers to the image file that should be placed in the\\n/iot-server/backend/uploads/device\\ndirectory. This image will be displayed in the mobile app (e.g., \"ecard.png\").\\ntitle\\n: The display name for the device (e.g., \"E-Card\").\\ntype\\n: Device type identifier (e.g., \"E-CARD\").\\nDevice Parameters\\n: Parameters specify data points each device supports. These parameters will be passed to the web app Blockly editor for creating new services.\\nIf a parameter’s\\nvalue\\nis an empty array\\n[]\\n, it indicates dynamic data input.\\nIf\\nvalue\\nhas specific options (e.g.,\\n[\"Open\", \"Close\"]\\n), it will show these options in the Blockly dropdown as predefined outputs.\\nB.4.1.

Ultimately, you\\'ll get a nicely formatted\\nzap-report.html\\nyou can open in any browser.\\n📦 1. Install Java Runtime Environment (JRE)\\nZAP requires Java to run. Begin by updating your system and installing the default JRE:\\nsudo apt update\\nsudo apt install default-jre -y\\njava -version\\nYou should see a version output confirming Java is installed. Example:\\nopenjdk version\\n\"\\n11.0.20\\n\"\\n2023-07-18\\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.20+8-Ubuntu)\\n🐳 2. Install Docker\\nDocker lets us run ZAP in a lightweight container without manual setup. Install and configure Docker:\\nsudo apt update\\nsudo apt install docker.io -y\\nsudo systemctl\\nenable\\ndocker\\nsudo systemctl start docker\\nsudo usermod -aG docker\\n$USER\\n🧰 3. Pull OWASP ZAP Docker Image\\nDownload the official stable ZAP image:\\nsudo docker pull zaproxy/zap-stable\\n📁 4. Prepare Report Directory\\nCreate a directory to store your report and make it writable:\\nsudo mkdir /home/security-report\\nsudo chmod -R 777 /home/security-report\\ncd\\n/home/security-report\\nThis ensures the ZAP container can write the report files without permission issues.\\n🚀 5. Run ZAP Baseline Scan\\nNow run the security scan:\\nsudo docker run -v\\n$(\\npwd\\n)\\n:/zap/wrk/:rw zaproxy/zap-stable zap-baseline.py -t https://\\n<<\\nnode-address>>/app/api\\n-r zap-report.html\\nMake sure to replace\\n<<node-address>>\\nwith your actual domain or IP address.\\nExample:\\npanel.zksensor.tech\\n🕓 Note: This process can take a while depending on your network and app complexity.\\n📊 6. View Results\\nOnce the scan is complete, the following files will appear in your\\n/home/security-report\\nfolder:\\nzap-report.html\\n— Main visual report (open this in any browser)\\nzap.yaml\\n— Scan configuration and results in YAML format\\nTo review the results:\\nDownload the\\n/home/security-report\\nfolder to your local machine.\\nOpen\\nzap-report.html\\nin a browser to inspect potential vulnerabilities.\\nAbout\\nAn IoT Management System for registering IoT devices, communicating via the MQTT protocol, managing users, and more.\\nwww.fidesinnova.io\\nTopics\\nblockchain\\niot-platform\\ndid\\nverifiable-credentials\\nverifiable-computation\\ndepin\\nverifiable-computing\\ndepin-alliance\\nResources\\nReadme\\nLicense\\nView license\\nActivity\\nStars\\n3\\nstars\\nWatchers\\n1\\nwatching\\nForks\\n1\\nfork\\nReport repository\\nReleases\\nNo releases published\\nPackages\\n0\\nNo packages published\\nContributors\\n6\\nLanguages\\nTypeScript\\n94.3%\\nHTML\\n1.8%\\nCSS\\n1.5%\\nHandlebars\\n1.0%\\nJavaScript\\n0.9%\\nShell\\n0.4%\\nSCSS\\n0.1%\\nFooter\\n© 2025 GitHub,\\xa0Inc.\\nFooter navigation\\nTerms\\nPrivacy\\nSecurity\\nStatus\\nDocs\\nContact\\nManage cookies\\nDo not share my personal information\\nYou can’t perform that action at this time.'),\n",

Build and Execute\\nTo automate the setup and build processes for both the backend and frontend applications, run the\\ninitial_setup.sh\\nscript located in the root directory of the project. This script will handle building both the backend and frontend applications and configuring PM2 services automatically. If you are installinng the exlorer on an EC2 AWS instance, use the following command.\\ncd /home/zkp-explorer/\\nsudo chmod +x initial_setup_backfrontend.sh\\nsudo chmod +x initial_setup_python.sh\\nsudo ./initial_setup_backfrontend.sh\\n./initial_setup_python.sh\\nNote: the last command must be used without \\'sudo\\'.\\nMaintenance: ZKP Explorer Code or Config Change\\nEvery time Fidesinnova core development team push a new version of the code on GitHub.\\ncd /home/zkp-explorer/\\nsudo git fetch\\nsudo git pull\\nEvery time you pull a new version of the server code from GitHub or you make a change to any\\n.env\\nfiles in the system, you should apply the changes to your production server via update script.\\ncd /home/zkp-explorer/\\nsudo chmod +x update.sh\\nsudo ./update.sh\\nUseful commands for troubleshooting\\n# to make file writable and other permissions :\\nchmod +rwx chainthreed\\n\\n# see busy ports\\nsudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN\\n\\n# something similar to the top one\\nsudo ss -ltn\\n\\n# kill a port\\nsudo kill -9 $(sudo lsof -t -i:6060)\\n\\n# see firewall status\\nsystemctl status ufw\\n\\n# restart the firewall\\nsystemctl restart ufw\\n\\n# move something into something else:\\nmv source target\\n\\n# delete a directory or file\\nrm -rf directoryName\\n\\npm2 list                               # Show running processes  \\npm2 show my-app                        # Show details of a specific process  \\npm2 stop my-app                        # Stop a process  \\npm2 restart my-app                     # Restart a process  \\npm2 delete my-app                      # Remove a process from PM2\\npm2 logs                               # Show logs of all processes\\nYou can install packages in a virtual enviroment\\nsudo su\\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-venv python3-full -y\\nsudo python3 -m venv web3env\\nsource web3env/bin/activate\\npip install web3\\npip install pymongo\\npip install polynomial\\npip install numpy sympy\\npip install fastapi\\npython -c \"import web3; print(web3.__version__)\"\\n\\ndeactivate\\nPython files description\\nmonitor_blocks.py: write the newly created blocks to blockchain_data\\npolynomial.py: a math library to be used by verifier.py\\nSC-commitment.py: read commitment from the protocol smart contract and write into the database\\nSC-service-device.py: read the published services from the protocol smart contract and shared devices into the database.\\nSC-zkp.py: read the zkp from the protocol smart contract and wrtie them into the database.\\nverifier.py: bring the \\'fastapi\\' module up to provide the \\'app\\' api for zkp verification purposes.\\n🔐 Automated Explorer Security Scan with OWASP ZAP (Docker)\\nThis guide walks you through setting up Java, and Docker, and running a baseline security scan using OWASP ZAP against a explorer endpoint. Ultimately, you\\'ll get a nicely formatted\\nzap-report.html\\nyou can open in any browser.\\n📦 1. Install Java Runtime Environment (JRE)\\nZAP requires Java to run. Begin by updating your system and installing the default JRE:\\nsudo apt update\\nsudo apt install default-jre -y\\njava -version\\nYou should see a version output confirming Java is installed. Example:\\nopenjdk version\\n\"\\n11.0.20\\n\"\\n2023-07-18\\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.20+8-Ubuntu)\\n🐳 2. Install Docker\\nDocker lets us run ZAP in a lightweight container without manual setup. Install and configure Docker:\\nsudo apt update\\nsudo apt install docker.io -y\\nsudo systemctl\\nenable\\ndocker\\nsudo systemctl start docker\\nsudo usermod -aG docker\\n$USER\\n🧰 3. Pull OWASP ZAP Docker Image\\nDownload the official stable ZAP image:\\nsudo docker pull zaproxy/zap-stable\\n📁 4. Prepare Report Directory\\nCreate a directory to store your report and make it writable:\\nsudo mkdir /home/security-report\\nsudo chmod -R 777 /home/security-report\\ncd\\n/home/security-report\\nThis ensures the ZAP container can write the report files without permission issues.\\n🚀 5. Run ZAP Baseline Scan\\nNow run the security scan:\\nsudo docker run -v\\n$(\\npwd\\n)\\n:/zap/wrk/:rw zaproxy/zap-stable zap-baseline.py -t https://\\n<<\\nnode-address>>/app/api\\n-r zap-report.html\\nMake sure to replace\\n<<node-address>>\\nwith your actual domain or IP address.\\nExample:\\npanel.zksensor.tech\\n🕓 Note: This process can take a while depending on your network and app complexity.\\n📊 6.

Json and both the Prov and the verifier has access to this file now let's go to our programming environment Visual Studio code and start writing this Fibonacci series example in cira first create an empty file and set it as Fibonacci circum every circum code begins with the directive pragma circum and then the circum version which in our case is 2.0.6 to start the execution an initial component must be a specified by default the name of this component is Main only one main components can be defined we write component main equal R circuit the main component needs to be instantiated with a template templates are the mechanism for creating genc circuits in circum they Define circuits and they have their own signals for example we write template Fibonacci and during the compile time the function argument must be known as in this example we assign 1,00 to n the arithmetic circuits built using circum operate on signals the signals are named with an identifier and declared using the keyword signal also can be defined as input or output for instance signal input FIB 1 signal input FIB 2 and Signal output fee n signals may not Define as input or output like signal S1 in this case there are considered intermediate also you may want to create an array of input like this one signal output S2 n be careful to avoid using reserved keywords as your signal name here is the list of reserved words in circum that cannot be used as signal names apart from signals circum also uses variables variables are identifiers that store nons signal data and are mutable they are declared using the keyword V variables can contain either numerical values of the field or arithmetic Expressions particularly when used to build constraints variable assignments is achieved using the equal symbol like variable a equal FIB 1 variable V equal fib2 or v c also you can create an array of variables like v v one and initialize your variable like this one once again please ensure that you are not using a reserved keyword as a variable name then we continue with Fibonacci computation compute fibo Nici sequence we write a four to calculate the last number in our Fibonacci series for where I from 0 to nus1 I ++ and this three lines your code is ready to test your circuit first save your circum program and then use the following command to compile your circum code go to the terminal and type type circum fibon na. c-- R1 CS if everything goes fine you should see this message everything went okay and provides a short summary for you then you can find the R1 CS in the same folder this one Fibonacci R1 CS now we are going to quickly go over the types of expressions in circum there are four types constant values these are simply fixed numbers like five or seven linear Expressions which are the sum of variables and constants like 5 FIB 1 + 7 FIB 2 + 12 and then quadratic Expressions which are formed by multiplying two linear expressions and adding another linear expression for example 5 FIB 1 plus 7 f 2 plus 12 * 9 f 1 + 4 F2 these type of expressions are allowed in circum the next one is not quadratic Expressions this category include any Expressions that do not fit into the previous one like 5 f 1 7 F2 + 12 9 F1 4 F2 then times FIB one this is not allowed in circum as you see this template mult multi3 has V1 V2 V3 and one output signal called VN VN cannot be V1 V2 and V3 this is not allowed so we have to follow this format let's go back to our programming environment and do a test as you see in this code we have three signals V1 V2 V3 I saved this code and then go to my terminal and type circum test 2. circom output R1 CS as you see circum compiler shows me this error non quadratic constraints are not allowed so I go back in my code and comment this line I will save and try it again now it's working fine now let's discuss the signal assignment operation so I go back to my Fibonacci code and do the assignment for my output signal assignment in Fibonacci can be done using this operation ation also to create a constraints for our circuit we can use FIP and 3 equals c this instructs the circum compiler to generate a circuit that accepts only the signals where the value of FIB one is equal to that of C the safer operation is this operation feep and this operation combine the first two to do an assignment and create a constraint therefore I remove the first two lines and only keep the third line then type times FIP one save it and go to the terminal to test it again circum fibo na. circum D- R1 CS\"),\n",

Additionally, the\\nadversary may introduce a rogue IoT device to generate\\nand transmit data to other users or IoT actuators, com-\\npromising the system’s integrity. Hence, the concern\\nabout IoT functions, which is a result of executing\\nits ﬁrmware or program, hinders the ability to fully\\nleverage the interconnected capabilities of IoT device\\n[1].\\nAddressing the above-mentioned challenge not only\\nensures the integrity of executed computations but also\\npaves the way for autonomous IoT device communi-\\ncation.

Here, the prover\\nshares only the output of a speciﬁc function, without\\ndisclosing the input (secret), along with a proof. In\\nthe ZKP realm, functional commitment is a protocol\\nthat hides a function f from the veriﬁer, yet allows\\nthe veriﬁer to conﬁrm the correctness of the function’s\\nexecution without needing to rerun it or know the\\nprecise function [2], [3].\\nTackling the issue of computational integrity within\\nthe IoT realm paves the way for the development of\\nsolutions that facilitate autonomous device communica-\\ntion among devices that may not inherently trust each\\nother.

As it is shown in Fig. 3, the zk-\\nIoT framework consists of ﬁve main elements: zk-\\nDevices, ZKP scheme, service contracts, blockchain\\nnodes, and blockchain protocol. The architecture is\\nstructured across three tiers. The top tier, known as the\\nphysical layer, houses the zk-Devices. The middle tier,\\nor the data layer, includes the data relay mechanism,\\nwhich facilitates data transfer and bridges the physical\\nworld with the blockchain realm. The bottom tier, the\\nblockchain layer, serves as the trust foundation for the\\nframework. It incorporates blockchain nodes to store\\nZKPs and uses smart contracts to facilitate the data\\ntransfer process.\\nA. zk-Device\\nIn the zk-IoT framework, every IoT device is\\nequipped with a ZKP generator to prove the integrity\\nof its executed programs. Fig. 4, shows the inputs for\\nthe computation originating from IoT sensors, while\\nthe program is stored within the IoT device’s memory.\\nThe zk-Device proves that its output originates from\\na circuit designed by the manufacturer, certifying that\\nthe IoT device operates exactly as intended by its\\nmaker. It also guarantees that both the program and\\nits inputs remain unchanged. As a result, the device’s\\noutput is reliable and trustworthy. Upon completion of\\nthe computation, the output, along with the generated\\nproof, is transmitted from the IoT device to the ex-\\nternal physical world.

Service Contract\\nRealizing automated IoT device communication re-\\nquires a mechanism to encode the interaction logic\\namong IoT devices. This is achieved through what we\\ncall a Service Contract. A Service Contract speciﬁes the\\nprotocol for IoT device communication, detailing how\\ndata produced by one IoT device can be utilized by\\nothers. Additionally, it ensures the integrity of the data\\ngenerated at each step by verifying the ZKPs produced\\nby IoT devices engaged in a contract. Service contracts\\nunlock the potential of IoT devices by amalgamating\\nthe functions of individual, isolated devices to create\\nnew, integrated functionalities. For example, employ-\\ning a service contract to merge the functionalities of\\ntemperature sensors in a wide residential area with a\\nsiren in a ﬁre department can create an effective ﬁre\\ndetection system. Similarly, integrating a temperature\\ndisplay in a hydro company could lead to an efﬁcient\\nenergy management system. These types of integrations\\nserve as prime examples of how service contracts can\\ninnovatively augment the capabilities of IoT devices.\\nAlgorithm 1 outlines the basic logic contained in\\na service contract, which processes a set of inputs\\nincluding GPS coordinates, a timestamp, a road status\\n(possible car-accident or road problem), the device\\ntype, and a proof verifying the integrity of the ﬁrmware\\nexecution that produced the input data. The process\\nbegins by verifying the proof. If the device is identiﬁed\\nas a Tesla and the data’s location is pinpointed to\\nSeattle, the algorithm then forwards the road condition\\ninformation and timestamp to the next device in the\\nservice chain. The practical implementation of this\\nprocess for a multi-sensor system will be explored\\nin the performance evaluation section, with examples\\nusing JavaScript programming.\\nAlgorithm 1 Service Contract Pseudocode.\\nInput: Proof P, GPS L, Timestamp Ti, Collision Ci,\\nDevice Type D\\nOutput: Temperature To, Temperature Co\\nRequire: Verify (P) ==valid\\nRequire: Compliance(P;D;0Tesla0) ==valid\\n1: if city(L)==0Seattle0 and type(D)==0Tesla0 then\\n2: Return Ti as To\\n3: Return Ci as Co\\nD. Blockchain Node\\nThe blockchain node is a critical component\\nin blockchain technology, responsible for executing\\nblockchain algorithms, including consensus algorithms,\\nsmart contract execution, block creation, and transac-\\ntion veriﬁcation. It also maintains the blockchain data\\nin what we call ’hot storage,’ which is replicated across\\nall nodes in the network.\\nWithin the IoT domain, each device is required to\\ntransmit its physical data to a storage system and may\\nreceive commands from it. We call it ’cold storage’.\\nThis data exchange is secure and exclusive, establishing\\na direct trust relationship between a node and an IoT\\ndevice.\\nIn the zk-IoT framework, IoT functionalities are\\nintegrated into the blockchain node, creating a node that\\nfeatures two distinct databases for hot and cold storage.\\nHot storage is dedicated to blockchain data, such as\\nZKPs, transactions, and smart contracts. Cold storage,\\non the other hand, houses a local copy of data from zk-\\nDevices and service contracts. Unlike hot storage, cold\\nstorage is not automatically shared across the network.\\nInstead, data transfer between source and target nodes\\nactivated by a service contract.\\nE. Blockchain Protocol\\nIn the context of zk-IoT, every automated interaction\\ninvolves a series of steps designed to facilitate commu-\\nnication and execution among different IoT devices.\\nThese interactions are grounded in the fundamental\\npremise of a straightforward exchange between two IoT\\ndevices. Without loss of generality, this section will\\nfocus on the interaction of only two devices under a\\nservice contract. The ﬁrst device generates data, which\\nthe second device then receives, veriﬁes, and uses as\\ninput for its own ﬁrmware execution, subsequently\\ngenerating new data along with a ZKP for the next\\ndevice.\\nThe workﬂow of the blockchain protocol is detailed\\nin Figure 6. The process is initiated by a service\\ncontract but requires sufﬁcient tokens from the second\\ndevice, which receives the data. To illustrate this,\\nwe describe the process beginning with zk-Device B\\ndepositing tokens into a smart contract distinct from\\nthe service contract. This dedicated smart contract\\nserves solely as a reserve pool speciﬁcally for data\\ntransactions and is designed to hold and disburse tokens\\naccording to a predeﬁned sequence.\\n1) Deposit Tokens: The Device Owner B deposits\\nsufﬁcient tokens into the zk-Device A’s smart\\ncontract.\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: The University of British Columbia Library.

P ERFORMANCE EVALUATION\\nWe have developed a preliminary version of the zk-\\nIoT system as described below. The service contracts\\nwere crafted using JavaScript due to available ZKP\\nlibraries like SnarkJS that enable the users to verify the\\nproof while letting the user to encode the complex inter-\\nactions required for automating processes across mul-\\ntiple IoT devices. The underlying blockchain network\\nutilizes Ethereum technology Proof-of-Authority (PoA)\\nconsensus algorithm, supplemented by a specially mod-\\niﬁed blockchain node designed to run IsolatedVM, en-\\nabling it to execute JavaScript-based service contracts.\\nAlso, the blockchain node supports the Message Queu-\\ning Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol for the non-\\nblockchain part to communicate with zk-Devices.
